    <h2 class="section-heading">A Deep Dive Into Deepfakes</h2>

    <p>
      A book investigating deepfakes, computer vision, and related technologies. A deepfake of myself onto Tim Cook
      introducing new Apple products begins the book, and a deepfake of myself into Elon Musk in an interview about AI
      brings the reader out. Different sections present multiple explorations of using AI tools for design: the creation
      of deepfakes, the use of image-recognition algorithms, the use of Vuforia’s computer image recognition ”targets”
      as a visual effect, and a machine learning-based text-to-emoji translator.

    <h2 class="section-heading">Abstracting Theory through Technology</h2>

    <p>
      Since the author is known for talking about symbols, I ran Baudrillard’s famous “Simulation and Simulacra” through
      a machine learning-based <a href="https://emojitranslate.com/" target="_blank">emoji translator</a>. I found the
      original text nearly impossible to read, so I think that it is an improvement.

    <h2 class="section-heading">Embodying Success</h2>

    <p>
      Graduating ArtCenter caused more self-reflection and anxiety than I expected. By embodying successful figures in
      design and technology, could I shortcut the whole job hunting process and propel my career?
