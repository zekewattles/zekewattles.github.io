    <p>
      Five top graphic design students and one instructor travel to Berlin to
      concept and design an interactive installation for a tech client. The
      client had something really unique: a new type of LED with the power of
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do I mean by that? Most commercial lighting operates at a relatively
      limited spectrum — it’s why you might get a headache after sitting under
      fluorescent lights for too long. All light has a color temperature — it’s
      also why golden hour looks so good. Somehow, this company managed to
      design a type of LED that could replicate the deepest reds and the coolest
      blues, at nearly the full range of natural light. And at low energy input.
      That’s a pretty big deal.

    <p>
      So how do you communicate the power of the sun? By letting light speak for
      itself. The blade is a visceral experience of pure light—a massive slice
      of sunset, on loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back of the blade functions as seating. Relax and watch the sunset —
      then, the second sunset begins. It’s like watching a sunset that you can
      walk right up to and touch. The power of this lighting is its relation to
      nature.
