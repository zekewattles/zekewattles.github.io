    <h2 class="section-heading">Can deepfakes be a design tool?</h2>

    <p>
      I‘ve been fascinated with the phenomenon of deepfakes. For the unfamiliar, a deepfake is a video that uses
      artificial intelligence to map one person’s face onto another. To create a good one, all you really need is two
      video sources, with one face each, in a variety of angles and expressions. But could there be a side of deepfakes
      that’s less scary, Black Mirror-esque? Yes. A passionate karaoke performance is the perfect vehicle for capturing
      deepfake data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, I learned the software by experimenting with deepfaking myself into successful design and tech “heroes”
      like Tim Cook and Elon Musk. I wondered if there could be a deeper side to this idea of deepfaking &mdash; what
      does it mean to “embody” someone? To take their voice?
    </p>

    <!-- After extensive research into the process of creating deepfakes, I concluded that karaoke is the perfect vehicle
    for collecting data to create deepfakes with. Deepfake Karaoke is an installation designed for the creation of a
    piece of video art: a collection of everyday people singing “Heroes” from David Bowie, then deepfaked into the
    original music video. While most deepfake videos focus on grafting one famous face onto another, Deepfake Karaoke
    takes a more democratic approaching, giving everyday people the opportunity to be heroes... just for one day. -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">Creating content</h2>

    <p>
      I chose the song “Heroes” by David Bowie as my initial deepfaking video. Its music video is a perfect candidate
      &mdash; it features Bowie and Bowie only, with plenty of close-up shots. Thematically, the lyrics are a perfect
      fit &mdash; what if you could, through technology, become your heroes, too?
      <!-- Videos were chosen on both the basis of featuring primarily one face per video, and for thematic content.
      (You’ll always be a part of me...) -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">Data collection</h2>

    <p>
      To make a good deepfake, you need multiple facial angles. A brief “calibration” video ensures this data is
      collected.
