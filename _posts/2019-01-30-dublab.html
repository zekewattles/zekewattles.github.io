    <p>
      Growing up in LA, music was all around me. From high school cellist to
      self-taught bedroom producer and
      <a href="https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php">GameBoy DJ</a>, I
      loved exploring sound in any way I could. So I’ve been a fan of
      <a href="https://www.Dublab.com/">Dublab</a>, an independent online radio
      station started in 1999, for a very long time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dublab had grown — but its identity was static. It wasn’t communicating
      their core ethos: a raw, experimental platform for the growth of music,
      art, culture, and everything in between.

    <h2 class="section-heading">Drawing with Sound</h2>

    <p>
      Most of Dublab’s audience are familiar with digital music tools, many of
      which can be used for visualizing sound. Dublab’s identity takes it a step
      further: <em>drawing with sound.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The code is based on Ted Davis’s
      <a href="https://teddavis.org/xyscope/">XYscope</a> library for
      <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, modified for use with
      both static images and a Kinect camera or webcam. It is used for both
      static visuals and a large-scale, interactive sound installation. Without
      getting overly technical, it works like a feedback loop: images are
      translated to sound, sound is visualized on the oscilloscope, then that
      sound is filtered, which affects the image again. But you don’t need to
      know all that to use it. Basically,
      <em>it’s just really fun to play with.</em>

    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Custom Typefaces</h2>
    <p>
      Two typefaces were developed for Dublab based around sound: DB 70 is a
      true monospace revival of Data70 in sine- and square wave variants; DB
      Circuit is a connected digital “script” based on the way type is rendered
      on oscilloscopes.
    </p> -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">DB Circuit Mono</h2>

    <p>
      Circuit is a display typeface combining the idea of a circuit and a
      musical staff. The grid is based on a musical staff: 5 lines with one
      interval between each. The method of drawing is based on the concept of an
      electrical circuit and the way a vector display (i.e., oscilloscope)
      renders type: as continuous, connected lines. The typeface is built in
      Glyphs with two styles that can be layered to create the connected effect.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">DB Data Mono</h2>

    <p>
      Taking inspiration from the typographic language of early synthesizers and
      sci-fi cinema, Data Mono is a re-drawing of Data70 as a true monospaced
      font. To relate to the idea of sound, there are two variatiants: the
      original, analog, “sine wave” variant, and hard-edged, digital, “square
      wave” variant built on the same anatomy.
