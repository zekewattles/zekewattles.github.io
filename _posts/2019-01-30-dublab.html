    <h2 class="section-heading">What It Is</h2>

    <p>
      Dublab is an online radio station based in Los Angeles.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Why It Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Growing up in LA, music was all around me. From high school cellist to
      self-taught bedroom producer and
      <a href="https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php">GameBoy DJ</a>, I
      loved exploring sound in any way I could. So I’ve been a fan of
      <a href="https://www.Dublab.com/">Dublab</a>, an independent online radio
      station started in 1999, for a very long time. Dublab had grown — but its
      identity was static. It wasn’t communicating their core ethos: a raw,
      experimental platform for the growth of music, art, culture, and
      everything in between.

    <h2 class="section-heading">Drawing with Sound</h2>

    <p>
      Most of Dublab’s audience are familiar with digital music tools, many of
      which can be used for visualizing sound. Dublab’s identity takes it a step
      further: drawing with sound.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Creating Tools</h2>

    <p>
      The code is based on Ted Davis’s
      <a href="https://teddavis.org/xyscope/">XYscope</a> library for
      <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, modified for use with
      both static images and a Kinect camera or webcam. It is used for both
      static visuals and a large-scale, interactive sound installation. It works
      like a feedback loop: images are translated to sound, sound is visualized
      on the oscilloscope, then that sound is filtered, which affects the image
      again.
      <!-- But you don’t need to
      know all that to use it. Basically, it’s just really fun to play with. -->

    <h2 class="section-heading">Custom Typefaces</h2>

    <p>
      Two typefaces were developed for Dublab based around sound: DB Data Mono
      is a true monospace revival of Data70 in sine- and square wave variants;
      DB Circuit Mono is a connected digital “script” based on the way type is
      rendered on oscilloscopes.
    </p>
    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">DB Circuit Mono</h2>

    <p>
      Circuit is a display typeface combining the idea of a circuit and a
      musical staff. The grid is based on a musical staff: 5 lines with one
      interval between each. The method of drawing is based on the concept of an
      electrical circuit and the way a vector display (i.e., oscilloscope)
      renders type: as continuous, connected lines. The typeface is built in
      Glyphs with two styles that can be layered to create the connected effect.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">DB Data Mono</h2>

    <p>
      Taking inspiration from the typographic language of early synthesizers and
      sci-fi cinema, Data Mono is a re-drawing of Data70 as a true monospaced
      font. To relate to the idea of sound, there are two variatiants: the
      original, analog, “sine wave” variant, and hard-edged, digital, “square
      wave” variant built on the same anatomy.

      <p>
        Talking to Mark, he became a partner in the process. I took the initiative to talk to the client directly and asked, what would be useful to you? He mentioned that Dublab had a large archive of interviews with musicians that he felt was important to preserve. I proposed a print version. I used the same text tool I built for Indeterminacy to create chapter breaks, and DB Circuit Mono for the cover typography. The first edition is a conversation with Van Dyke
