            Formosa is a warm, sturdy grotesque typeface inspired by vernacular signage in Los Angeles. While much of
            its geometry reflects models of the past, its construction is informed by warmth, clarity, and performance.
            Its name comes from the street and iconic LA restaurant. üç¥
