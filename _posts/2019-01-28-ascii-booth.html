            ASCII Booth takes a nostalgic piece of old technology—the dot matrix printer—and recontextualizes it as an
            instant ASCII art selfie booth.

        <p>
            At the ArtCenter Grad Show, most booths are no more than a display of a variety of work from students’
            tenure, which is impressive in its own right. But I wanted to create something fun and event-specific with a
            unique and memorable take-away.

        <p>
            The photo booth concept stemmed from a conversation with Dublab’s <a href="https://www.dublab.com/djs/ale" target="_blank">Ale</a>, whose endless enthusiasm, excitement,
            and support pushed me to finish, and coding help from the incredibly talented <a href="http://alitorbati.com/" target="_blank">Ali Torbati</a>.

            a screen connected to a Raspberry Pi,

        <p>
            It proved to be the most popular and Instagrammed part of the grad show—there were crowds around it the
            entire event. Seeing the genuine joy and excitement of participants was the best part of the whole event.
            Even crossed-arm creative directors couldn’t help but crack a smile.
