            ASCII Booth takes a nostalgic piece of old technology—the dot matrix printer—and recontextualizes it as an
            instant ASCII art selfie booth.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing my <a href="{{"/work/dublab" | relative_url }}">Dublab concept project</a>, I hit up Mark
            and Ale and arranged a visit to the Dublab studio to share the work. Unfortunately, they had announced a new
            brand and website exactly the same time I had finished my project. But they liked the energy, and I was
            eager to make something real.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ale loved the dot matrix printer but wasn’t convinced by the <a
                href="{{"/indeterminacy/" | relative_url }}">poster generator</a>. He asked if we could turn it into a
            photo booth. I didn’t know how we would, but I said yes.
        </p>

        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Back Story</h2>
        <p>
            The photo booth concept stemmed from a conversation with Dublab’s <a href="https://www.dublab.com/djs/ale"
                target="_blank">Ale</a>, whose endless enthusiasm, excitement,
            and support pushed me to finish, and coding help from the incredibly talented <a
                href="http://alitorbati.com/" target="_blank">Ali Torbati</a>.

        <h2 class="section-heading">ASCII</h2>
        <p>
            The ASCII art is both aesthetic and functional. Dot matrix printers are designed for printing plain text
            documents. I learned from my <a href="{{"/work/order_and_chaos" | relative_url }}">previous project</a> that
            printing anything else was incredibly slow, and forcing people to wait too long for their photo to print
            wasn’t
            ideal. I also learned that plain text printing worked only from a Windows machine.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Interface</h2>
        <p>
            The interface shows you what will print. It converts the webcam image to text using JavaScript, and pauses
            and downloads the current page as a text file when a button is pressed. I styled the page in CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            What you don’t see is the footer. Since the whole thing is text, there’s a unique built-in opportunity for
            messaging: event name, time stamp, sponsors, secret codes, and ASCII logos. The footer can be changed for
            each event.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Physical Build</h2>
        <p>
            I built the booth out of MDF to fit the dimensions of the printer. A set of caster wheels at the bottom
            makes it easy to transport. The booth is built like a shelving unit, with flat shelves for the laptop and
            printer, and a drawer in between to house the button and hide the Arduino and wiring behind it.

            First Run: Grad Show
        </h2>
        <p>
            The ArtCenter Grad Show is a chance for hardworking students to display the work they feel best represents
            them, and hopefully will land them a job. I am interested in both graphic design and interaction, and wanted
            to show something event-specific with a personalized take-away. Who needs another tote bag?
        </p>
        <p>
            It was the most Instagrammed part of the grad show and there were crowds around for the whole event. For me,
            seeing the genuine excitement of participants was the best part of the weekend.

            Second Run: Dublab’s 20th Anniversary Weekend
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Grad Show was also the first real user testing for the booth. For the <a
                href="https://www.dublab.com/events/78254/dublab-20th-anniversary-party" target="_blank">Dublab
                event</a>, Ali joined me, and here are some of the problems we solved:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There was a bug with photos double-printing, or not at all. It turned out to be an issue with Chrome in
                full-screen mode, so we didn’t do that.
            </li>
            <li>
                When we prototyped the booth, the “print” button was a UI element on screen accompanied by text
                instructions. When I added the Arduino button and told people to “press the big button”, half of users
                were confused as to which button I meant &mdash; physical or UI? The solution was to <strong>remove the
                    UI button</strong> and all text instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users always asked “what is this?” and “how does this work?” Initially, we gave a long explanation.
                After the end of the weekend, our <strong>verbal instructions</strong> went from 1-2 minutes to 10
                seconds.

                The Future
            </h2>
            <p>
                Dublab has expressed interest in doing more events. A permanent home in a public/retail space would be
                great, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a larger budget, the booth 2.0 would:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use a built-in screen connected to a Raspberri Pi instead of a laptop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a built-in flash or ring light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be self-sufficient. Currently, the dot matrix printer can jam unpredictably and a booth operator
                        needs to be present.

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            This self-initiated project shows my interests in experimenting and prototyping. It’s a graphic design,
            product design, branding, and interaction project in one.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a class project, your audience is your peers. This was the first time I created something where my
            audience didn’t know me at all, and the project had to be compelling, understandable, and functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a process of iteration, testing, and building, I achieved those goals. I collaborated with a
            developer to code the aspects I couldn’t figure out myself, and communicated with a real client along
            the way to deliver a project we both were happy with.
